        <p class="publish-date">March 17th, 2022</p>  
      </h1>
        <br>
      <div class="main">
        <p>In 1946, a university found itself in the midst of a housing crisis. It had enrolled more students, particularly World War II veterans, than it or the surrounding community could house. Facing a serious housing shortage, this university took bold action by partnering with the Federal Public Housing Authority (FPHA) to build temporary apartment housing on its former polo field for 252 returning veterans and their families. That university was Princeton University, and that housing project was called the Butler Tract.
        </p>

        <p>Finished in 1947, <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2015/06/our-dear-old-barracks-life-in-the-butler-tract/"> the Butler Tract </a>— a 36 acre plot of land located on the east side of Harrison Street, in between Hartley Avenue and Sycamore Road — grew to contain <a href="https://planetprinceton.com/2015/12/01/22697/">304 housing units</a> before its demolition in 2015. The Butler Tract lasted 63 years longer than originally intended. Despite its fairly utilitarian construction, it came to be a <a href="https://paw.princeton.edu/article/wonderful-life">beloved home</a> for many University graduate students and their families.</p>
        
        <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1144048"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p>The Butler Tract project occurred in an era when our most powerful institutions promoted housing with a sense of urgency. A decade after beginning to build public housing and subsidize homeownership in the 1930s, the federal government took unprecedented action by enacting <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/937573/theres-world-war-iiera-blueprint-looming-eviction-crisis">rent freezes</a> and mass producing housing for <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976535">migrant workers</a> and veterans.</p>

        <p>Through the Butler Tract, the University took similar steps to relieve the housing burden among its student population, and, more generally, within the Township and Borough of Princeton.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, the policies of this era generated massive racial inequities. A plethora of research has detailed how the federal government instituted <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america">blatantly racist policies within New Deal programs</a>, how the <a href="https://aas.princeton.edu/news/sordid-history-housing-discrimination-america">financial and real estate industries</a> perpetuated these policies, and how their effects reverberate throughout society to this day.</p>
        
        <p class="hover">As important as the Butler Tract was to relieving Princeton’s housing shortage, it was not immune from institutional trends promoting racial housing disparities. University records suggest that when the FPHA turned the property over to the University in 1948, all Butler Tract residents were white University-affiliated veterans and their family members.<input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">1</label><small>Quarterly Report on Occupancy in Veterans Housing, September 30, 1948, Box 2, Folder 1, Butler Tract Housing, Department of Grounds and Buildings Technical Correspondence Records, ACO35, Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library.
        </small> Around the same time, Black veterans without the luxury of University affiliation experienced <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/princetonaffordablehousingproj/home">considerable housing instability</a> in Princeton. Perhaps in anticipation of how scarce housing in Princeton would remain, one University official emphasized that “outsiders not connected with the University would have no right whatsoever to demand the use” of the Butler Tract. <input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">2</label><small>Letter from George A. Brakeley to Edward A.

        <p>This history of institutionalized racism and our insufficient responses to it points to a crucial observation about racial inequities: institutional policies created them and institutional policies must end them.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>Policy responses to COVID-19’s aggravation of our <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_State_Nations_Housing_2021.pdf">pre-existing housing crisis</a>, such as <a href="https://evictionlab.org/covid-policy-scorecard/">eviction moratoria</a> and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/emergency-rental-assistance-program">emergency rental assistance</a> (while far from perfect), represent arguably the most significant housing interventions since the 1940s. They demonstrate that our governments can still <a href="https://evictionlab.org/eleven-months-cdc/">meaningfully respond</a> to housing problems and perhaps have given us a renewed sense of urgency about correcting the inequities caused by our governments and financial institutions decades ago.</p>

        <p>Nongovernmental institutions, particularly those like Princeton University that are anchored in areas of intense housing inequity, also need to recognize their unfulfilled roles. In past columns for The Daily Princetonian, I’ve documented <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2021/02/princeton-racial-justice-affordable-housing-policy">housing inequities within Princeton</a> and explained how <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2021/04/zoning-exclusionary-housingcrisis-princeton-residential">many homeowners exacerbate</a> them. This series is an attempt to show that Princeton University, <a href="https://njbiz.com/real-estatehow-princeton-university-became-a-land-giant/">one of the region’s largest landowners</a>, can reduce these inequities and has an obligation to do so.</p>

        <p class="hover">The University has a history of employment and housing discrimination. At the turn of the century, Princeton University made special efforts to help Italian laborers working at the University find affordable housing in and around the traditionally Black and under-resourced Witherspoon-Jackson neighborhood.<input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">3</label><small>Watterson, Kathryn. I Hear My People Singing: Voices of African American Princeton. Unabridged edition. Princeton University Press, 2017, 37.
        </small> This housing, which was practically the only option available in Princeton to Black residents, was often of poor quality and hazardous to health. Instead of improving living conditions for its Black dining hall employees living in the Witherspoon-Jackson neighborhood, which several <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Some_Unsolved_Social_Problems_of_a_Unive/BBbiAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">reports commissioned in the 1910s</a> recommended doing, the University fired its Black dining hall employees, replaced them with white employees, and built a dormitory for these new white employees elsewhere in the Borough.<input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">4</label><small>October 21, 1913, pg. 18; 1913 October 21-1915 January 14, Board of Trustees Records, AC120, Princeton University Archives, Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library; October 26, 1916, pg. 54, 1916 October 26-1917 June 16, Board of Trustees Records, AC120, Princeton University Archives, Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library
        </small> The University did this despite previously acknowledging “the obligation of the University to improve the living conditions” of its Black employees.<input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">5</label><small> Report to Committee on Grounds and Buildings of the Trustees of Princeton University from University Financial Secretary Andrew Imbrie, March 13, 1912, Box 50, Committee on Grounds and Buildings Minutes, Reports, 1912, Minutes, Reports, Correspondence; Board of Trustees Records, AC120, Princeton University Archives, Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library</small></p>
        
        <p class="hover">The University also indirectly participated in a controversial urban renewal program in the 1930s. To make way for Palmer Square, Princeton Municipal Improvement, Inc., led by Edgar Palmer Class of 1903, a <a href="https://findingaids.princeton.edu/catalog/AC120_c0039">University Trustee</a>,<input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">6</label><small>1935 October 24-1936 June 15, Board of Trustees Records, AC120, Princeton University Archives, Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library.
        </small> <a href="http://www.princetonmagazine.com/palmer-square-a-look-back/">displaced</a> many Black households that once lived where a collection of mostly high-end, boutique shops now stand. After Palmer’s death, Princeton University came to own much of the Palmer Square property until 1981, when it <a href="https://njbiz.com/how-princeton-university-dealt-with-a-downtown-gift/">sold</a> the property for $17 million.</p>
        
        <p>The University continues to aggravate housing inequities today. Most notably, it does little beyond the bare minimum to help supply housing for the people it draws into such an exorbitantly expensive, housing-starved area. By <a href="https://finance.princeton.edu/risk-management-tax-rents-mortgages/mortgages">subsidizing mortgages</a> for faculty and upper-level staff – members of the University community with likely the lowest need for housing assistance — Princeton University likely helps inflate local housing costs. In comparison, the University provides housing to only a subset of graduate students (<a href="https://gradschool.princeton.edu/life-princeton/our-community/residential-life">roughly 70 percent</a>) by lottery and limited <a href="https://finance.princeton.edu/risk-management-tax-rents-mortgages/mortgages/external-lending-options">financial assistance</a> to low and moderate income employees, some of whom live <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2018/05/university-workers-rights-to-be-discussed-at-yds-town-hall">paycheck to paycheck.</a></p>
        
        <p class="hover">The University surely recognizes this decades-old <a href="https://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/?a=d&d=Princetonian19480319-01.2.12&srpos=48&e=------194-en-20--41-byDA.rev-txt-txIN-harrison+st-ARTICLE-----">problem</a>. A 1970 Housing Market Study commissioned by the University highlighted the acute housing needs of low and moderate income households, including University staff, and recommended that the University should develop hundreds of affordable housing units. It also called for the University to consider opening up University housing to low and moderate income households in the community.<input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">7</label><small>Housing Market Study from James D. Landauer Associates, Inc., August 26, 1970, Box 377, Folder 9, Princeton Community Housing–Low and Middle Income Housing, Office of the President Records: Robert F. Goheen Subgroup, AC193,  Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library.
        </small> As recently as 2005, internal surveys have suggested that <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2005/10/university-program-to-help-staff-finance-homes-2">many University employees spend more than 50 percent</a> of their income on housing alone.</p>
        
        <p>These actions (and inactions) have likely contributed to the displacement of Black households from Princeton over time. While the municipality has grown alongside the University over the past 100 years, the share of its Black population has declined considerably over the same period. According to Census Bureau records, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents made up nearly one in five residents. By 1980, that number fell to one in 13 and by 2020, one in 17. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/princetonaffordablehousingproj/home">Decades</a> of documented racial discrimination along with a chronic lack of affordable housing in the municipality likely explain much of the exodus of Black residents.</p>
        
        <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1155941"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p>These <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/priceonomics/2016/05/11/the-african-american-exodus-from-san-francisco/?sh=4676be575595">patterns exist elsewhere</a>, particularly in areas where massive, for-profit tech companies have been implicated for their role in the housing crisis. Like Princeton University, these companies aren’t singularly responsible for the crisis — after all, many local governments have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Flsg_mzG-M">failed to zone</a> for sufficient amounts of multifamily housing — and these companies do provide economic benefits to the region. Yet, while companies such as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-makes-housing-commitment-valued-at-1-billion-11560886992?mod=article_inline">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-donating-1-billion-toward-affordable-housing-in-silicon-valley-11571760000">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-pitches-in-an-additional-65-million-for-affordable-housing/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/why-apple-is-investing-2-5-billion-in-housing">Apple</a>, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendarichardson/2021/06/16/amazon-commits-300-million-to-develop-affordable-housing-in-three--cities/?sh=7304b8101458">Amazon</a> have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to support affordable housing in their communities, these contributions represent tiny fractions of their overall wealth and are <a href="https://www.npr.org/local/305/2020/01/16/796995014/tech-companies-are-throwing-money-at-the-housing-crisis-advocates-are-skeptical">insufficient</a> given the scale of the problem.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, Princeton University, one of the <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2021/10/princeton-endowment-returns-2021-ivy-league#:~:text=Princeton's%20endowment%20remains%20the%20highest,roughly%20%244.6%20million%20per%20student.">wealthiest</a> and most well-renowned universities in the world, does little to address ongoing housing inequity in the area. It does support the municipality through <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2021/04/02/university-contributions-princeton-town-2020-summary">voluntary contributions</a>, both in the form of property taxes on the housing it owns and payments in lieu of taxes (<a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/working-papers/payments-lieu-taxes-nonprofits">PILOTs</a>), but not on the scale necessary to change the status quo. Even the recent <a href="https://paw.princeton.edu/article/university-pay-182-million-settle-tax-suit-residents">$18.2 million settlement</a> challenging the University’s non-profit status did not meaningfully address housing inequities in Princeton. Peer institutions like Harvard University, through its <a href="https://community.harvard.edu/housing">Local Housing Collaborative</a>, have helped finance and preserve thousands of affordable housing units. Initiatives like this demonstrate that the University can do more.</p>

        <p class="hover">Fortunately, the University has demonstrated its capacity to be a part of the solution in the past. In the late 1960s, it joined an emerging coalition of organizations in the area to promote housing affordability.<input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">8</label><small>Princeton Community Housing–Low and Middle Income Housing, Office of the President Records: Robert F. Goheen Subgroup, AC193,  Department of Special Collections, Princeton University Library.
        </small> In the 1970s, University administrators publicly supported and offered credit for the development that became <a href="https://www.pchhomes.org/princeton-community-village">Princeton Community Village</a>. University President Robert Goheen’s administration pursued the construction of 1,500 low and moderate income housing units before President Nixon’s moratorium on federal housing subsidies undermined their plans.<input id="h1" type="checkbox"><label for="h1">9</label><small>Ibid.</small></p>
        
        <p>More recently, the University has <a href="https://community.princeton.edu/news/university-gives-50000-and-sweat-equity-build-habitat-humanity-home-princeton">helped finance</a> affordable home ownership and has <a href="https://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/?a=d&d=WeeklyBulletin19890206-01.2.42&srpos=10&e=------198-en-20--1-byDA.rev-txt-txIN-butler+tract------">sold</a> and <a href="https://walkableprinceton.com/2018/08/28/franklin-ave-interim-lot/">donated</a> land to help the municipality reach its state-mandated affordable housing targets, leading to the development of affordable housing units both at the Butler Tract and the <a href="https://hres.princeton.edu/faculty-staff-housing/explore/merwick-stanworth-townhouses-and-apartments">Merwick-Stanworth apartments</a>. Its <a href="https://facilities.princeton.edu/projects/lake-campus-graduate-housing">Lake Campus development</a> will house many more graduate students, which will likely open up units elsewhere in the municipality for others. These are positive steps that we can and should build upon.</p>
        
        <p>One obvious place for the University to strengthen its commitment to affordable housing is the Butler Tract, which has remained vacant since 2015. Currently, the University has no plans for the land, but has <a href="https://en.calameo.com/read/0008049750f1d739b8d74?page=0">indicated</a> that it could be used for University housing in the future. Yet, given the dire lack of affordable housing in Princeton and how ideal the Butler Tract is for development, the University clearly lacks a sense of urgency by leaving the land vacant in the near-term. The municipality of Princeton currently has one of its most pro-housing Councils in decades, if not ever. The time for Princeton University to act is now.</p>
